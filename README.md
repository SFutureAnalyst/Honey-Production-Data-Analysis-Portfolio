### Context:

In 2006, there was widespread concern about the rapid decline of the honeybee population, which is an essential component of American honey agriculture. Many hives were lost due to "Colony-Collapse-Disorder," a phenomenon in which disappearing "worker-bees" cause the remaining "hive-colony" to collapse. Though no overall consensus has been reached, speculation about the cause of this disorder points to hive diseases and pesticides harming pollinators. Some industries are recovering after twelve years, but the American honey industry is still struggling. Historically, the United States produced more than half of the honey it consumed each year. Honey is now mostly imported from other countries, with 350 million pounds of honey consumed each year coming from imports. From 1998 to 2012, this dataset provides information on the supply and demand for honey in the United States by state.

### Objective:

The Goal is to use Python visualization libraries such as seaborn and matplotlib to investigate the data and get some useful conclusions.

### Questions:-

1. Import required libraries and read the dataset.

2. Check the first few samples, shape, info of the data and try to familiarize yourself with different features.

3. Display the percentage distribution of the data in each year using the pie chart.

4. Plot and Understand the distribution of the variable "price per lb" using displot, and write your findings.
5. Plot and understand the relationship between the variables 'numcol' and 'prodval' through scatterplot, and write your findings.

6. Plot and understand the relationship between categorical variable 'year' and a numerical variable 'prodvalue' through boxplot, and write your findings.

7. Visualize and understand the relationship between the multiple pairs of variables throughout different years using pairplot and add your inferences. (use columns 'numcol', 'yield percol', 'total prod', 'prodvalue','year')

8. Display the correlation values using a plot and add your inferences. (use columns 'numcol', 'yield percol', 'total prod', 'stocks', 'price per lb', 'prodvalue')
